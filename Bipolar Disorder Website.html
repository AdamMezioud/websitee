    <h1>mind virus "Bipolar Disorder"</h1>
    &lt;&gt; Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental
    disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods of abnormally
    elevated mood that each last from days to weeks If the elevated mood is
    severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less
    severe, it is called hypomania During mania, an individual behaves or feels
    abnormally energetic, happy or irritable, and they often make impulsive
    decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually also a
    reduced need for sleep during manic phases During periods of depression, the
    individual may experience crying and have a negative outlook on life and
    poor eye contact with others The risk of suicide is high; over a period of
    20 years, 6% of those with bipolar disorder died by suicide, while 30\40%
    engaged in self-harm. Other mental health issues, such as anxiety disorders
    and substance use disorders, are commonly associated with bipolar disorder.

    <p>
      In bipolar 1, the highs are called mania. These episodes are more severe
      than bipolar 2. For example, while a person with bipolar 2 may feel they
      need less sleep than usual during a manic episode, an individual with
      bipolar 1 may go for days without sleeping at all. Symptoms of mania often
      lead to disruption in daily life and social activities, and can cause
      problems in personal relationships. Mania can also trigger a break from
      reality â€” a condition known as psychosis. Symptoms of psychosis can
      include delusions, hallucinations and disorganized thoughts or reasoning.
      In some cases, psychosis may require hospitalization.

    <p3>While there's no surefire way to completely prevent bipolar disorder,
      there are several strategies that may contribute to maintaining mental
      well-being and reducing the risk of experiencing the disorder. Engaging in
      a healthy lifestyle, practicing self-care, and seeking professional help
      when needed can all play a role in supporting mental health. Remember that
      individual experiences and risk factors can vary, so it's essential to
      consult with medical professionals for personalized guidance.</p3>
    <p4>Engaging in proactive steps to promote mental well-being can be a key
      approach in potentially reducing the risk of bipolar disorder. Maintaining
      a balanced and healthy lifestyle through regular exercise, proper
      nutrition, and sufficient sleep can contribute to emotional stability.
      Managing stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and engaging
      in hobbies or activities that bring joy can aid in emotional resilience.
      Developing strong social connections and a support network can provide an
      outlet for sharing feelings and seeking guidance.</p4>
